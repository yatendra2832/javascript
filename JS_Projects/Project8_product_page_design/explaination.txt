This code is a JavaScript snippet that handles image switching based on button clicks. It selects an image element and a group of buttons and sets up event listeners to change the displayed image when a button is clicked. Here's a breakdown of each line:

let productImg = document.getElementById("productImg");:

This line selects an HTML element with the id attribute "productImg" and assigns it to the productImg variable. This element is likely an image that you want to change.
let btn = document.getElementsByClassName("btn");:

This line selects all HTML elements with the class "btn" and assigns them to the btn variable. These elements are likely the buttons that, when clicked, will change the displayed image.
btn[0].onclick = function() {:

This line sets an onclick event handler for the first button (btn[0]). When this button is clicked, the following function is executed.
productImg.src = "/images/image1.png";:

Inside the function, this line sets the src attribute of the productImg element to "/images/image1.png," changing the displayed image to the first image.
for (const bt of btn) { bt.classList.remove("active"); }:

This loop iterates over all the buttons in the btn array and removes the "active" class from each button. This is done to remove the "active" styling from all buttons, indicating that they are not currently selected.
this.classList.add("active");:

The this keyword refers to the button that was clicked (in this case, btn[0]). It adds the "active" class to the clicked button, indicating that it is currently selected or active.
The code for the second and third buttons is nearly identical to that for the first button, with the only difference being the image source they set and the index of the button (btn[1] and btn[2] respectively). The code for the second and third buttons follows the same structure as the first button, changing the displayed image and updating the "active" class when clicked.

In summary, this code allows you to switch the displayed image by clicking different buttons. When a button is clicked, it changes the src attribute of the image, removes the "active" class from all buttons, and adds the "active" class to the clicked button to indicate the current selection.
